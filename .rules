## Project Context
This project is a landing page for a digital marketing business built with:
- **Astro** (v5.7+) - Static site generator and framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **TailwindCSS** (v4.1+) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **DaisyUI** (v5.0+) - Component library built on Tailwind
- **AstroIcon** (v1.1+) with Iconify - Icon system using MDI icon set
- **pnpm** - Package manager
- **ESLint & Prettier** - Code formatting and linting

## Development Guidelines

### Framework Usage
- Always use Astro's component system and static site generation features
- Prefer Astro components (.astro files) for pages and layouts
- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Leverage Astro's built-in optimizations for images, CSS, and JavaScript

### Styling & Components
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling
- Prefer DaisyUI components when available instead of custom implementations
- Use semantic component names from DaisyUI (btn, card, hero, navbar, etc.)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
- Use TailwindCSS dark mode utilities when needed

### Icons & Assets
- Always use AstroIcon with Iconify instead of SVG files
- Use MDI (Material Design Icons) icon set: `<Icon name="mdi:icon-name" />`
- Optimize images using Astro's built-in image optimization
- Keep assets organized in the public directory

### Code Quality
- Write type-safe TypeScript with proper interfaces and types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations already set up

### File Structure
- Components in `src/components/`
- Pages in `src/pages/`
- Layouts in `src/layouts/`
- Utilities and types in `src/lib/` or `src/utils/`
- Static assets in `public/`

### Performance & SEO
- Use Astro's static generation by default
- Implement proper meta tags and structured data
- Optimize Core Web Vitals
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size

### Shell & Tooling
- Default shell is Nushell
- Use pnpm for package management
- Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript strict mode

Always prioritize clean, maintainable code that follows modern web development best practices while leveraging the full power of the Astro ecosystem.
