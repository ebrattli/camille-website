      <div slot="overview">
        <p>
          Nordic Wellness, a chain of premium fitness centers in Norway,
          approached me to revitalize their social media presence. Despite
          having quality facilities and services, their online presence didn't
          reflect their premium brand positioning, and engagement was low across
          all platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The goal was to transform their social media channels into effective
          marketing tools that would increase brand awareness, engage their
          target audience, and ultimately drive more membership sign-ups.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div slot="challenge">
        <p>
          When I began working with Nordic Wellness, they faced several
          challenges:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Inconsistent posting schedule with gaps of several weeks between
            posts
          </li>
          <li>
            Low-quality visuals that didn't reflect their premium brand
            positioning
          </li>
          <li>Minimal engagement with followers (likes, comments, shares)</li>
          <li>No clear content strategy or brand voice</li>
          <li>
            Poor integration between social media and other marketing efforts
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited use of platform-specific features (Stories, Reels, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Additionally, they were struggling to differentiate themselves in a
          competitive market where many fitness centers had already established
          strong social media presences.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div slot="solution">
        <p>
          I developed a comprehensive social media strategy focused on
          showcasing Nordic Wellness's premium facilities, expert trainers, and
          unique approach to fitness and wellness.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">The strategy included:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Content Pillars:</strong> Established four content pillars (Facility
            Showcases, Trainer Spotlights, Member Success Stories, and Wellness Tips)
            to ensure varied yet consistent content
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual Identity:</strong> Created a cohesive visual style with
            a premium aesthetic, including templates for different content types
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Calendar:</strong> Implemented a consistent posting schedule
            with 4-5 posts per week across Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engagement Strategy:</strong> Developed protocols for responding
            to comments and messages, and proactively engaging with followers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Platform-Specific Content:</strong> Tailored content for each
            platform, leveraging platform-specific features like Instagram Stories
            and Reels
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community Building:</strong> Implemented member spotlights and
            user-generated content campaigns to foster community
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics & Optimization:</strong> Set up regular performance
            tracking and reporting to continuously optimize the strategy
          </li>
        </ul>
