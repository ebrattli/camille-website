      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Camille, the founder of Tarsier Digital Solutions. My
        journey to digital marketing started in an unexpected place – the
        classroom. As an educator with a passion for clear communication, I
        discovered that the same skills that made me an effective teacher were
        invaluable in the world of marketing.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        After transitioning from education to project management in the
        corporate world, I found myself drawn to the creative and strategic
        aspects of marketing. I loved helping brands tell their stories and
        connect with their audiences in authentic ways.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        With a multicultural background and experience working across borders, I
        bring a unique international perspective to my work. I'm especially
        passionate about supporting immigrant-led businesses and purpose-driven
        brands that are making a positive impact in their communities.

              Why "Tarsier Digital"?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-6">
              The tarsier is one of the world's smallest primates, but what it
              lacks in size, it makes up for with extraordinary vision and
              precision. With eyes larger than its brain, the tarsier can spot
              the smallest details in its environment.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base-content/80 mb-6">
              Just like this remarkable creature, our digital agency may be
              small, but we have an exceptional eye for detail and the ability
              to spot opportunities that others might miss. We're nimble,
              focused, and precise in our approach to marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base-content/80">
              And while tarsiers might be tiny, they're known for their
              impressive leaps — just like the growth we help our clients
              achieve.
